  This app is a job-search platform where you can log in as a recruiter or a
  talent and perform various actions depending on the type of user you are. My
  first full-stack web app for Codaisseur's academy's final project. For the
  front end, I used React and Redux in TypeScript. The database is written in
  Javascript using Sequelize and Postgres and is connected to an express server
  built with Node.
