## About

> I'm Juri, a web developer from Italy. I'm passionate about tech and I love creating innovative and performant applications that make people's lives easier. I find learning new technologies and creating solutions to difficult problems massively rewarding.

The projects I'm working on right now live on the client side and are mostly React led. My evenings at the moment are spent learning node.js and Express. My long term goal is to become an effective full stack developer, able to efficiently turn great ideas into working products.
