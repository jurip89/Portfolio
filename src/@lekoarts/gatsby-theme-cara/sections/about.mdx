## About

> I'm Juri, a web developer from Italy. I'm passionate about tech and I love creating innovative and performant applications that make people's lives easier. I find learning new technologies and creating solutions to difficult problems massively rewarding.

I was always curious by nature and curiosity is the sole reason that opened doors for me and lead me towards some life-changing experiences that made me, me.

Since I was 20 I have lived in various countries around the world and had the opportunity to collaborate with people of various nationalities and cultural backgrounds. Through this, I learned to adapt quickly to new situations, but my curiosity was never satisfied until I began coding.

This lead me towards Codaisseurâ€™s full stack developer Bootcamp confirmed my passion and allowed me to recognize that I have what it takes to become a successful developer.
